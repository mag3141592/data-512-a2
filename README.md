# Exploring Bias in Wikipedia's Political Articles by Country

## Goal
This repository contains all files required for Human Centered Data Science's (DATA 512) "Assignment 2: Bias in Data." More information about the assignment is available [here](https://wiki.communitydata.cc/Human_Centered_Data_Science_(Fall_2018)/Assignments#A2:_Bias_in_data).

The purpose of this assignment is to explore potential biases in Wikipediaâ€™s political coverage by country. I explore this using two metrics:
<p>__Coverage__: The percent of political articles per country population.</p>
<p>__Quality__: The percent of high-quality political articles per country's total political articles. A high-quality article will be one considered either a _Freatured Article (FA)_ or a _Good Article (GA)_ (These are the highest 2 of Wikipedia's 6 article quality options).</p>
