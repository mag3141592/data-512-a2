# Exploring Bias in Wikipedia's Political Articles by Country

## Goal
This repository contains all files required for Human Centered Data Science's (DATA 512) "Assignment 2: Bias in Data." More information about the assignment is available [here](https://wiki.communitydata.cc/Human_Centered_Data_Science_(Fall_2018)/Assignments#A2:_Bias_in_data).

The purpose of this assignment is to explore potential biases in Wikipediaâ€™s political coverage by country. I explore this using two metrics:
__Coverage__: The percent of political articles per country population.
__Quality__: The percent of high-quality political articles per country's total political articles. 

Article quality will be determined using a machine learning algorithm called _Objective Revision Evalution Service_ ([ORES](https://ores.wikimedia.org/v3/#!/scoring/get_v3_scores_context_revid_model).  This algorithm predicts between the following options:
* FA - Featured article
*	GA - Good article
*	B - B-class article
*	C - C-class article
*	Start - Start-class article
*	Stub - Stub-class article

A high-quality article will be one considered either a _Freatured Article (FA)_ or a _Good Article (GA)_. The highest 2 of Wikipedia's 6 article quality options.

Then I reported on reflected on the highest and lowest ranked countries for each metric. The [Jupyter Notebook]() will walk you through the full analysis.
